        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
            If you are interested in a commission, please fill out the form on my Commission Form page. This will ensure that I receive all the relevant information and means I will be able to get back to you quickly.
            When sending reference images please only send images in JPEG or PNG formats and not in ZIP files. RefSheet and Imgur links are also accepted.
            The number of projects I take on will vary, I will email you with confirmation if I am available to take on the project.
            My commission queue can be viewed on my queue page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once we have agreed the outline, I will send you the PayPal invoice. This invoice can be paid 100% upfront or 50% upfront and 50% after your approval of the sketch.
            Once the invoice has been paid I will start work on your sketch; I will send updates throughout the process where you can ask for minor changes.
            Once completed, I will send a low resolution, watermarked JPEG of the final piece and then, if you are happy, I will send the high resolution JPEG through to your email.
